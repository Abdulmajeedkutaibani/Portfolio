    the client requested a business card, Logo, Professional Emails, Domain name and a website for his company and requested that there be a contact form and the ability to navigate the website in English and Arabic Versions, and the client also requested a widget in the webiste that allows visitors to check live Currency Exchange prices.
    
    developing this webiste allowed me to use the i18next react translation library and have fun with translating the website to arabic and use conditioned rendering to detect the language selected by the user and render text from right to left or the opposite.
    
    I also enjoyed developing the currency exchange widget which is super useful for visitors and shows many currencies.`,
